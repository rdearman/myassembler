[] create functions for all instructions
[] support the _data label. the underscore indicated variable name.
[] way to separate program memory from storage memor (probably hardware not software)

============

[X] import bytecode to generate instructions.
[X] first two bytecodes are always the same, make the constructor default: 
    load PC into MAR
    load MDR into IR
[X] define all descreet bytecodes for use in instructions. (bindgen)
[X] make small asm program which can be used to match simple machine code (Working program not a list of instructions)
[X] Do multiple passes? Need to define memory addresses for labels and data first. 
[X] support labels further down in file (may need 2 step lex, first for labels and data)
