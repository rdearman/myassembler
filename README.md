# myassembler

This is a very hacky attempt at creation of an assembler for my 8-bit breadboard CPU. It is primarily an exercise in learning more about electronics and the rust programming language. It should in no way be considered useful for anyone who doesn't own my homemade CPU. 

I've designed the assembly language to be like GAS syntax, but it doesn't support most things.
